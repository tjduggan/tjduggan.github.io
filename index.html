                Hello, I am TJ. Welcome to my website. I am a student at Missouri State University and I am studying statistics and computer science. I have a passion for math and enjoy developing my coding ideas. I am in my third year and want to go on to work in data science, software engineering, or data analysis. When I am not focused on school, I love to workout, play ultimate frisbee, travel, and hangout with friends. Thanks for visiting my website. This is my first time using HTML or CSS, so it is a constant work in progress. Come back and check to see my updates. Thanks!
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the summer of 2023, I wanted to implement better habits for myself. I needed a way to keep myself more accountable in an organized way. I wanted something very simple and couldnt find anything that fit what I wanted on the appstore. So I created it. After using resources like youtube, stackexchange, and github I learned the basics of Swift. I made a basic app for me to use to track my daily habits. 
                <br/>
                The app features the following:
                <ul>
                <li>Expandable list for habits</li>
                <li>Swipe left to delete, swipe right to add the habit to all the following days</li>
                <li>Calendar to easily flip between dates</li>
            </ul>

            </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <h4 class = "project-header-web">This Website!</h4>
            <p>
                As a way to implement my coding skills, I decided to create this personal website. I was able to teach myself the basics of HTML with the help of the youtube channel Traversy Media. His videos on HTML and CSS helped me create this whole website. There were quite a few learning curves. Before working on this, I had only coded in object oriented languages. Python and C++ were the only two programing languages I had experience in. This led to a lot of unexpected obstacles I had to overcome.
                <br/>
                The biggest problems I had included the following:
                <ul>
                <li>Syntax - When I started working in HTML it was difficult to understand the syntax as well as I wouldve liked. I was used to more helpful and predictive IDE's that came with C++ and Python</li>
                <li>Formatting - Working in a language that is used pretty exclusively for front-end work is much different. I had to learn how to format text and focus on how things look rather than just their function.</li>
                <li>Getting the website live - I had never gone through a process to implement something I created for public use. It wasn't as straighforward as I had originally thought.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
